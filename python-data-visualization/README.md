# Python Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is focused on visualizing the Iris dataset using scatter plots. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers, including petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width, and species. The main script generates visualizations that help in understanding the relationships between these dimensions.

## Files
- `src/GraficoDispersion.py`: The main script for data visualization.
- `data/iris.csv`: The dataset used for visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Installation
To set up the project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the data visualization script, execute the following command:

```
python src/GraficoDispersion.py
```

This will generate scatter plots for the petal and sepal dimensions of the iris flowers, colored by species.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Make sure to install these libraries before running the script.
